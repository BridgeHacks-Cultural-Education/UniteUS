    <p> Alvin Ailey was born into poverty in Texas in 1931. Drawing from “his emotional well of close-knit black churches, rural juke joints, fiery protest songs, and a lonely childhood as a closeted gay man to fuel his passion for dance” (<em>The Undefeated</em>). He started his own dance company and school that was unlike any other, inviting multicultural dancers and building his company to be an amalgam of the African and European diaspora (Susan Fales-Hill, <em>The Undefeated</em>). His company showcased the pain of the African-American journey, but also the “triumph and redemption of the human spirit” like in <em>Revelations</em> (1960), his most celebrated work that finds beauty, hope, and resilience in the midst of tragedy and pain—a poignant message especially today. <br> 
    He was a pioneer of programs promoting arts in education, particularly those benefiting underserved communities, and after his death from an AIDS-related illness in 1989, the company and school grew into the premier repository for emerging black choreographers it is today. Ailey was awarded the Kennedy Center Honor in 1988 in recognition of his extraordinary contribution to American culture, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014 in recognition of his contributions to civil rights and dance in America. </p> <br>
