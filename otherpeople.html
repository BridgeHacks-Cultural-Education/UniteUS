    <p>      Richard Allen was born into servitude in 1760 in Philadelphia. He earned $2,000 to buy his and his brother’s freedoms, just as the antislavery movement and denominational Christianity were gaining prominence. He is considered the founder of America’s first independent black denomination, the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, which has a membership of more than 2.5 million people and 6,000 churches today. In his biography, he wrote, “I was awakened and brought to see myself, poor, wretched and undone, and without the mercy of God must be lost.” He was ordained the church’s pastor and later elected bishop, to which he served until his death. <br> 
         Allen dedicated his life to the abolitionist movement and to justice: he focused his sermons on the freedoms of slaves, cessation of colonization, education for youths, and temperance; he opened a day school for black children and a night school for adults; his home and Bethel AME were stops on the Underground Railroad; he published articles in <em> Freedom’s Journal</em>; he authored three pamphlets about escaping the bonds of slavery. His fearless and inspiring legacy lives on today in the AME church’s work, exemplified through its motto: “God Our Father, Christ Our Redeemer, the Holy Spirit Our Comforter, Humankind Our Family.” </p> <br>
